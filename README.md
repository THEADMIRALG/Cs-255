# Cs-255

The purpose of this assignment was to create a system design for the company DriverPass. The application they were looking to create is meant to help student drivers practice before their driving exams.
For this project I feel a strong point for me were my UML diagrams. All of my diagrams hit all the key points the company was looking for while nopt making it overly complicated so a non-technical audience could 
understand them. If there was anything that nheeded improvement on this project I think it would be thebusiness design requirements document. I feel I could have been more specific with the company's needs in the system.
This goes hand in hand with figuring out exactly what the coompany would need in their design. It is important to understand what is required for the company to get the most out of the system in order to give them a complete product.
